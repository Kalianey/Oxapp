## OXAPP

OXAPP is a messenger Android app for the open source social community software <a href="https://www.oxwall.com/" target="_blank">Oxwall</a>. 

## Installation

This app was built for a personal project which has been abandonned since then. The app is almost finished, but could use some debugging and improvements. You should be able to run it with its <a href ="https://github.com/Kalianey/owapi" target="_blank">companion backend plugin</a>. Once you have set it up in your Oxwall backend, just change the API base url, title of the app, and the launching screen in Android Studio. Due to a lack of time I cannot provide support of any kind.

## Contributors

The app is functional but the messenger is not working so well, so feel free to improve if you find it useful.
